# Welcome to Quick Intel

Over 50,000 users have been scammed out of more than 1 billion dollars in cryptocurrency. After seeing so many scam victims, the Quick Intel (QKNTL) team identified a need to help crypto enthusiasts quickly and efficiently identify potentially risky code hidden within the project's contracts.&#x20;

Quick Intel is a **suite of cryptocurrency security tools** designed to provide real-time assessment of project contracts and provide users with immediate feedback on potential malicious code within a token's contract.

With Quick Intel, users scan a token's contract address using one of our various tools. The results of the contract address are generated using our unique first-of-its-kind code analysis that digs deep into the code to provide alerts on known scams and malicious code.
