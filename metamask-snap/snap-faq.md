# Snap FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is a MetaMask Snap?</summary>

_MetaMask Snaps allows users to add features and functionality to their MetaMask wallet. Individual snaps are features created by third-party developers that MetaMask users can install directly into their wallets. We believe that a decentralized internet that is accessible to all and owned by the people who use it will give rise to human flourishing on an exponential scale. Whilst our roots are in Ethereum, and our expertise is grounded in building the leading self-custodial wallet, we appreciate that innovation occurs in many domains across the web3 ecosystem. With Snaps, we hope to capture the full extent of the innovation happening in Web3 by enabling developers to bring their specialist expertise to build our platform._
