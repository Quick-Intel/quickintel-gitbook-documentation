Token Details

1. In this section, you will have information like the Token Name, Token Symbol, Contract Address (for validation of contract interaction), and whether the Contract has been verified.

The next section is broken down into two sections.

2. This is the **Warnings** section. Here, you will get a count of the number of warnings identified and the number of warnings that were returned.
3. This is the **Caution** section. Here you will get a count of the number of caution items identified and each warning item returned.

A link to view a **Full Audit** directly on the Quick Intel dApp.

4. With each audit result, a link will be provided that sends you directly to our Quick Intel scanner app, where you can view the full scan results in depth.

While the Quick Intel Snap is meant to provide users with a quick and seamless way to identify potential risks in tokens they may be buying; further research is always recommended when possible.
