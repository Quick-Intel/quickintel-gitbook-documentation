Ever feel like you're playing roulette with your crypto? Investing mindlessly into crypto projects is risky and not a game you want to play.

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, a network of scammers lurk, ready to strike on those lured by dreams of easy wealth and vanish with your hard-earned money.

But what if you had a way to see the unseen, to see the vulnerabilities in smart contracts that are often hidden or easily overlooked? The stuff scammers don't want you to see.

Well, now you can - Introducing ShadowShield!



## **What Is ShadowShield?**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**ShadowShield is Quick Intelâ€™s anti-scam solution for protecting your crypto. Think of it like an X-ray**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">**for smart contracts.**</mark> It detects hidden vulnerabilities in smart contracts that may not be visible to the naked eye.

### _How it Works:_

ShadowShield leverages artificial intelligence to analyze over 500,000 smart contracts, meticulously dissecting their code and identifying red flags that hint at potential scams.

This vast data pool fuels our AI to discern patterns and anomalies that often characterize fraudulent contracts. ShadowShield then predicts the likelihood of a smart contract being a scam. No more hidden scams, no more lost crypto!

Sound familiar? Originally launched in beta in May of 2023, you may know this as our AI Confidence tool. But not only have we changed the name, we've revamped it.
